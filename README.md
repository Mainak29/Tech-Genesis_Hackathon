# Trash Segregation, Collection & Reward Using Python And TensorFlow

## Problem Statement:
#### Trash Management is a very big problem around the world. Specifically, in India, we know how the citizens are in terms of disposing their trash. And as plastic is a big threat to the ecosystem.
#### So to love this issue we have designed a trash collection machine which will detect the type of trash and segregate it. And provide rewards to the citizens.

 ### Vending Machine Design:
* Trash Recognition
* Collect Trash [ Mechanical ]
* Display Reward on Screen
* Addition feature: Account Connect for Reward
### Reward Type:
* Real Money Credit
* Coupons
### Trash Type:
* PET Bottles
* Plastic branded packages likes Chips, Biscuits
* Polythene Carrybag
* Plastic Straws, Spoon & Fork
### Tools for Implementation:
##### For Vending Machince Computation
* Webcam
* Python
* Image Recognizer [Opencv / Tensorflow]
### Reward Provider:
* Trash Recycling Company
* Govement/Municipal
* Advertiser
### Vending Machine Work Flow:
1. Gather sample images for training using TensorFlow
2. Then Feed Trash from Webcam
3. IF Trash true to sample images then
4. Collect Trash [Machanical]
5. Process Trash [Machanical]
6. Ask for reward type
7. IF reward type money
8. then Ask for Bank UPI ID
9. And then show Money Sent Message
10. Else Generate Coupons
11. And Display it.
12. Exit
13. And Additional: Forward this Info to Mobile App
14. Ask for Login iD
15. Then Exit
### Future plan:
##### Reward App Design: 
* Account
* Store Reward
##### For Mobile App
* Flutter
