# Roadside serially food booking with secured pin through online

## Problem Statement:
#### An individual can book his/her food from any location while travelling to get it served in his/her nearest coming outlet. He will get a serial number while booking which will be provided in an estimated time and also will be provided with the secure code or pin which will give the uniqueness and avaibality of the food for the particular customer.

### Process: 
When the customer make a booking request of the desired food, then the web admin will get a request and forward the booking to the nearby coming outlet of the customer. The serial number and the unique pin will be generated and assigned for the customer. The customer will recieve the serial number, pin and the estimated time of the delivery. The food will be only delivered to the particular customer by showing the generated pin.
Hence, this confirms uniqueness and avaibality for the particular desired food for the particular customer.
